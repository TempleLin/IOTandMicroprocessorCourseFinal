/*
It's possible that the digital output of the Arduino is not able to provide enough current to operate the valve. The Arduino's digital output pins can only provide a limited amount of current, 
typically around 40 mA. If the valve requires more current than this, it may not be able to operate properly when controlled by the Arduino.

One solution to this problem is to use a transistor to amplify the current from the Arduino's digital output pin. The transistor acts as a switch that can be controlled by the digital output 
pin, and it can provide much more current than the Arduino's digital output pin alone.

Here is an example of how you can use a transistor to control a valve with an Arduino:

    Connect the valve's control wire to the collector of the transistor.
    
    Connect the emitter of the transistor to ground.
    
    Connect the base of the transistor to a digital output pin on the Arduino.
    
    In your Arduino code, use the digitalWrite function to control the transistor by setting the digital output pin to either HIGH or LOW.

By using a transistor to amplify the current from the Arduino's digital output pin, you should be able to successfully control the valve.
